  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented by updating OKLCH CSS variables for primary/secondary/accent (and foreground counterparts) in both frontend/src/index.css and frontend/index.css. REQ-2 is only clearly addressed for the Admin panel section/overlay in the provided diffs; the diff summary does not provide evidence that other site sections (nav/hero/forms/cards) were updated to remove hardcoded mint/emerald/green/gray/white utilities. Several additional, non-requested styling/metadata changes are present (e.g., Orbitron font import, fade-in utilities, project_state.json feature-request entries, sidebar token additions).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Replace any hardcoded mint/emerald/green/gray/white color utilities in site sections and navigation with theme token-based classes so the updated blue/turquoise/gold theme is applied consistently across the app (nav bar, hero, forms, cards, admin overlay).",
      "reason": "The diff shows token-based class updates for the admin panel section/overlay, but does not include actual diffs for NavBar, HeroSection, Registration/Query forms, or other cards/sections; therefore there is insufficient evidence that hardcoded colors were replaced across the rest of the app.",
